/* Delete Node in a Linked List

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.


Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
*/

/* As we can't access node before the node which we want to delete .we will replace the node with value of next node and than delete it.*/

solution:

class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        *node = *(node->next);
    }
};
